My typing game project has a simple idea that is to type the shown words as fast as you can. It has very simple Ui, where you have to input the word shown and then click enter. The game ends after you successfully type 10 words then it shows the success message with your speed also.

With the help of functions and event listeners and referring the typing project tasked in the task repo i made this project. First we have a start game function where everything is initaialised and the setnewword function is called which helps to import random words from the array to our screen using math.random and array manipulations. Then we check input and if its correct then the score increases and a new word shows up. This continues until we reach a score of 10. After this end game function is called where i have calculated wpm with the help of getTime.
Resources used:
-Sample typing game provided in the repo.
-Google Stack overflow for doubts.
-ChatGPT as it helped me structure the code as for some reason prettier does not work in my vs code properly.
Screenshots for my project:

Initially i was trying to build a word shooter game where the words would fall from top and before touching ground we have to type and shoot, but had many errors and time consuming and as final submission dates approaching i went for this project.
