## cow-bull Game

Actually i have a created basic game only using the concepts that i learnt in the typing
its just a basic ,we need to guess the 4 digit number randomly generated by the computer 
and there is a 5 minutes time limit.you need to guess the number before time ends 
example suppose computer generates 1276 and u guessed 1265 ,when both number and position 
matchs it is bull when only number is present position is incorrect it shows cow
in this 1,2 is bull and 6 is cow .it will display the previous guessed data also.
